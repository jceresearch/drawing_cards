# xls_drawing_cards
Drawing cards game for 5 year old children

It selects words from a list of words based on its points (1-4) using the new FILTER() function. 
Then randomly picks words into a card "template". 
A macro generates the deck (recalculating each time, so there may be some degree of repetition) in the "deck" tab.

The "static" deck tab allows you to generate an A4 page with cards by recalculating, without needing the macro. 

Needs Excel O365 for the FILTER() function to work and the desktop app to run the macro
